This subdirectroy contains cif (crystallographic information file) files of the ML model's predicted perovskite sturctures. Please note that these structures are straight from the ML model and no dft relaxation simulations have been performed.

The rank number at the start of the name of the file indicates the which structures is the most stable (the lower the number, the more stable) according to the ML model.
