This is the main directory to the project. It is broken up into three parts. 

    The subdirectory "pre_relaxed_structures" contains the predicted perovskite structures from the machine learning model.
    
    The subdirectory "python_convertion" (sorry about the typo), contains conversion files to convert outputs from dft to cif files, as we cif files to xrd spectras

    The subdirectory "quantum_espresso_calc" contains Density Functional Theory (DFT) outputs from Quantum Espresso (QE) for proposed perovskite structures
