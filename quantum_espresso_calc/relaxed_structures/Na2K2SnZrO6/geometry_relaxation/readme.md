This directory contains input and output files of geometry relaxations.

To run these simulations, a geom.in and run.qsub file are needed. (note: that the "geom.in" files were renamed as "geom.in_x", where x is the first iteration of the calculation, since the calulation crashed and needed to be restarted.

These simulations produced a geom.out file, which was renamed in a similar fashion as the geom.in files. The file or last output file was renamed geom.out_final.
