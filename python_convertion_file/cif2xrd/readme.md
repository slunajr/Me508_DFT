XRD Generation Code:
Description: This code generates xrd spectra from a provided.cif file. For the context of this project, it was used for both the pre- and post-DFT structures. It creates an xrd plot of just the raw peaks from pymatgen as well as a plot with some peak broadening to simulate a more realistic output that you would get from experiments. Run this code first.
